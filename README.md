# AI and Computer Vision - Machine Learning Project

This project explores a dataset on AI and Computer Vision applications using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and builds a Random Forest classifier to predict the classification result of visual observations.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - AI and Computer Vision Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushikyad001/ai-and-computer-vision-dataset)
- Features include visual attributes such as `Confidence_Score`, `Blur_Level`, `Brightness_Level`, `Contrast_Level`, `Noise_Level`
- Target: `Label` with values: `Correct`, `Incorrect`, `Uncertain`

## Contents
- `Mini_Paper_AI_Computer_Vision_With_Visuals.docx`: Mini paper document with full analysis and visualizations
- `confusion_matrix.png`: Visual evaluation of model prediction results
- `feature_importance.png`: Graph of feature contributions from Random Forest
- `README.md`: This description file

## Model
A Random Forest classifier was used due to its robustness and interpretability. The model achieved over 90% accuracy in classifying the labels.
